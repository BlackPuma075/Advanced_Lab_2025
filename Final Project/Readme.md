# Advanced Lab — Final Project
## 📊 *Deducing $P(k)$ Properties Using Neural Networks*

Welcome to the repository for my Advanced Lab final project. This project explores the use of neural networks to analyze and characterize cosmological power spectra $P(k)$. 

Below you will find a guide to navigate the notebooks and documents in this folder.  
**⚠️ Please review the files in the order described here.**

---

### 📄 **Advanced_Lab_Final_Project_final (PDF)**
This is the **main report** of the project (latest version). It contains the full discussion, methodology, and results.  
> **Status:** *Work in progress.*

---

### 📄 **Advanced_Lab_Final_Project (PDF)**
First version of the report, included for reference and comparison.

---

### 📝 **PS_NN_final.ipynb**
**Main notebook** — reproduces all the results presented in the 'Results' section of the latest report.  
✅ **Recommended to run this notebook.**  
⏱️ Approximate runtime: 5-7 minutes.

---

### 📝 **PS_NN.ipynb**
Notebook used to produce the results of the **first** version of the report.

---

### 📝 **Spectra_production_test.ipynb**
Test notebook for generating the power spectra catalog. Useful for understanding how the dataset was produced.

---

### 📝 **Advanced_Lab_Final_Project_V5.ipynb**
Notebook containing an extended discussion of the neural network architecture. Includes code comments explaining the reasoning behind architectural and library choices.  
> ⚠️ **Note:** This notebook is partially commented and may not be fully ordered.

---

### 📝 **Activation_functions.ipynb**
Notebook that generates **Figure 1** in the report, illustrating different activation functions.

---

### 📝 **Advanced_Lab_Final_Project_v1, v2, v3, v4**
Earlier versions of the development notebook, included for timeline and documentation purposes.  
> ❗ **Not recommended for review** — fully superseded by `V5`.

---

### 📌 Status
- **Current focus:** Finalizing report and refining results.
- **Next steps:** Expanding the spectra catalog and further improving the model accuracy.
